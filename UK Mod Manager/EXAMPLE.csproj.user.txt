To get this file to work:
1. Rename it to "UKAPI.csproj.user"
2. Change the path below to be your Ultrakill path
3. Delete this text, so the first line is <Project ToolsVersion = "15.0"> and stuff

<Project ToolsVersion="15.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
    <PropertyGroup>
        <ULTRAKILLPath>C:\YOURPATHHERE</ULTRAKILLPath>
    </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
